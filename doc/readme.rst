Introduction
============

Want to design xia3, doing so by means of mocking up a user manual to figure out what we actually want to have. Use case 0: processing some prion data from Diamond Light Source i03.

==========
Use Case 0
==========

Start with a data set consisting of 48 sweeps of 100 x 0.1 degree
images. Want to:

* integrate data in P1
* discover symmetry, indexing ambiguity
* refine in correct symmetry, maybe reprocess with symmetry applied
* sort together
* assess isomorphism
* scale
* assess isomorphism

In the first cut, however then we want to also handle these ideas:

* add another data set
* remove a data set
